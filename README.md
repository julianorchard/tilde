This is probably my third time using dotfiles, but not in this repo. I began
with i3-gaps, as many people do. Then I moved to BSPWM. Now, I'm using Awesome,
partly because it feels more 'complete' than BSPWM out of the box, and partly
because I'm exploring Lua with Neovim, this time. 

I use a bare repo to sync the dotfiles.
